Extends the [canonical Go language Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/) with a compiled version of FFMpeg and associated libraries:  AAC, LAME, OGG, Opus, Theora, Vorbis, VPX, XVid, X264, X265

I need this image for testing of [goav](https://github.com/amarburg/goav) and my various projects that depends on it.   It also retains gcc, pkg-config, etc. for cgo.
